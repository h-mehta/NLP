Supervised ML & Sentiment Analysis
----------------------------------


In supervised machine learning, you usually have an input X, which goes into your prediction function to get your prediction

^
Y. You can then compare your prediction with the true value Y. This gives you your cost which you use to update the parameters 

Î¸. 

To perform sentiment analysis on a tweet, you first have to represent the text (i.e. "I am happy because I am learning NLP ") as features, 
you then train your logistic regression classifier, and then you can use it to classify the text.


Thus the steps become:

1. Extract features
2. Train the model
3. Use the model to predict
